# JoyCode Documentation

Universal, open‑source documentation tooling for the entire **JoyCode Studios** ecosystem.  
JoyCode Documentation provides a clean, consistent, and extensible foundation for writing, structuring, and publishing documentation across all JoyCode projects — from frameworks and runtimes to libraries, engines, and internal standards.

This repository contains the shared documentation layout, styling, components, and conventions used throughout JoyCode Studios.

## 📚 Purpose

JoyCode Documentation exists to unify how documentation is written and presented across the JoyCode ecosystem.  
Instead of reinventing layouts, styles, and patterns for every project, this repository provides:

- a shared design language  
- a consistent user experience  
- a predictable structure  

Whether you're documenting a language, a runtime, a library, or a tool, this repo gives you the foundation.
